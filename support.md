# App Store Connect - Support URL Requirements

## Overview

The **Support URL** in App Store Connect is a **mandatory field** that must direct to a live webpage containing actual contact information.

## Purpose

This URL allows users to reach the developer with:
- Questions
- Support issues
- Feedback
- Feature requests

## Requirements

1. **Must be a live webpage** - The URL must be accessible and functional
2. **Must contain actual contact information** - Users need a way to reach the developer
3. **Cannot be under construction** - Apple requires the website to be fully accessible
4. **Must be valid throughout app lifecycle** - Keep this URL active as long as the app is on the App Store

## Visibility

The Support URL is visible on the App Store **only to users who have purchased the app**.

## Best Practices

- Use a dedicated support email address
- Provide clear contact methods (email, contact form, etc.)
- Keep the page simple and accessible
- Ensure the page loads quickly and works on mobile devices
- Update contact information if it changes

## Example Support Page Content

A basic support page should include:
- App name
- Developer/company name
- Contact email address
- Brief description of how to get support
- Optional: FAQ section
- Optional: Link to privacy policy and terms of service

## For Mga Pinoy App

Current support email: `mgapinoydirectory@gmail.com`

A simple support page should be created with:
- Contact information
- Brief app description
- How to submit feedback or report issues
